# Acid Lick

[Pavel Dobryakov's fluids](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation), made audio reactive with [Clubber](https://github.com/wizgrav/clubber) and packaged as a chrome extension to visualize youtube videos.
For when you need to turn that tune into luscious imagery. Not a replacement for real acid, just a fine complement.
