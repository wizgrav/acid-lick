# Acid Lick

[Pavel Dobryakov's fluids](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation), made audio reactive with [Clubber](https://github.com/wizgrav/clubber) and packaged as a chrome extension to visualize youtube videos.
For those times when you need to turn that tune into luscious imagery. Not a replacement for real acid, just a fine complement.



### Install

Install from chrome store page.

Alternatively, download this repo in a folder then Tools > Extensions > Unpack folder (Needs dev options enabled)

### Usage

Once installed, youtube videos will display a link on the track's title. Lick and enjoy :)
